# Portfolio
the goal of this assignment was to create a portoflio that displays us and our work.

## general
the website has a dark purple theme with light text, content is center aligned to look sleek on both pc and mobile devices. minimal styling used outside of images for headshot and cards.

## about me
the headshot has a circular border and basic text underneath

## projects
the main card is linked once the project button is hit. It covers the majority of the users screen and features a project i started before bootcamp. 
each following card is designed to maintain a 2 per row system of images. the last 2 images are placeholders with no actual projects linked.

## contact
the contact section features a link to my github, a mailto for my email adress, and a placeholder phone number
